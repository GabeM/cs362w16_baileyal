For randomadventurertest

	the original randomadventurertest.c wasn't a very good test. For one it didn't even have any way to determine if it work. 
	Another thing is that the number of players can be 1 or 0, but the initializeGame function will simply return 1 if this is true.


	So to change those things I added a my_assert to the end to see if the card had increased the players hand count.
	
	
	after running it I realized that if you just the deckCount to 0, this will in effect remove those cards from the game. 
	So instead I added all the cards to the discard.
	
	For the adventurer random test, to test the effectiveness of the test, I removed certain lines of code, such 
	as the the shuffle call, the drawCard call, the drawnTreasure increment, to see if my test would catch them. 
	It caught all but the shuffle function, and upon further inspection, the shuffle call is not really impotant 
	because drawCard will also call shuffle.
	
For randomtestcard.c
	
	I chose the council_room card
	
	For this card i followed a similar skeleton code as the randomadventurertest, so I had to fix the same problems I encountered.
	
	I added an oracle that checks if all the players gained at least one card in their hand and then if the player who used the card
	had 4 more cards in their hand and 1 more buy.
	
	For the Council room, I removed the drawCard functions for both the user and the other players as well as changing the parameters 
	for the for loops and the test found all of these.
