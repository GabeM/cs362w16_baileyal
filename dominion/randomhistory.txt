For randomadventurertest

	the original randomadventurertest.c wasn't a very good test. For one it didn't even have any way to determine if it work. 
	Another thing is that the number of players can be 1 or 0, but the initializeGame function will simply return 1 if this is true.


	So to change those things I added a my_assert to the end to see if the card had increased the players hand count.
	
	
	after running it I realized that if you just the deckCount to 0, this will in effect remove those cards from the game. 
	So instead I added all the cards to the discard.
	
For randomtestcard.c
	
	I chose the council_room card
	
	For this card i followed a similar skeleton code as the randomadventurertest, so I had to fix the same problems I encountered.
	
	I added an oracle that checks if all the players gained at least one card in their hand and then if the player who used the card
	had 4 more cards in their hand and 1 more buy
