Bugs
	the bug I found in the village function is actually the one I introduced where the funciton doesn't increase
	the number of actions, it just sets the numActions to equal numActions. The bug in Baron is because there is 
	no discardCard call, so the card being used isn't discarded. I couldn't find any bugs in great hall or smithy
	
Coverage
	the coverage for these tests is very minimal, since it really only test a handful of functions and the cards 
	only call a handful of other functions. This would suggest that the tests are not great, as far as the whole 
	game is concerned.
