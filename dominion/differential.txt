I was confused about how this was supposed to be done as both tests were random and the things we output were different,
but the resulsts seemed to be similar in that they never played cards they weren't supposed to or had any bogus values.

because of the difference we had in displayed information and the randomness of the tests, I don't think the differences 
had much value by themselves.
