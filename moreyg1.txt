I found a bug relating to cardEffect and playCard. Using my card testers I was able to find that the way the two functions are implemented
prevents the cards Salvager, Embargo, Minion, and any other card that adds coins to the players coin count from working properly. On 
code inspection I found that the source of this error is that playCard calls updateCoins after running cardEffect and includes a bonus 
that is supposed to be updated by cardEffect. However, almost none of the coin increasing cards actually change this variable and 
instead add coins directly to the coin count, which is overwritten when updateCoins is called.
